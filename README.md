# CNNExercise
This was an exercise to help me learn convolutional neural networks. The project classifies pictures of shoes using a CNN based on an example in the TFLearn examples. 

There are two files:
    preprocess_images.py preprocesses a directory of images to make them suitable for being classified with the same CNN. 
    my_shoe_cnn.py imports the directories of preprocessed images and classified them as either depicting shoes or not depicting shoes.
